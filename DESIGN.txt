Systems Period 4
Final Project


Project Idea:
We are a recreating the game, Battleship, using networking across two computers. Each player has 5 ships: a 5-square 
aircraft carrier, a 4-square battleship, a 3-square cruiser, a 3-square submarine, and a 2-square destroyer. When the game 
starts, players choose where they want to position their ships. The game will continue prompting the users to enter 
locations to send missiles, and will display updated boards with the proper miss/hit symbols. When a ship sinks, a message 
will display which one it is. The game ends when one person sinks all of the opponent’s ships, and proper ending screens 
will display.


User Interface:
Our game will be played in the shell. The home territory will be displayed on the left side, and the opponent’s territory 
will be displayed on the right. The grids will be 10x10; the columns will be labeled A-J, and the row labeled 0-9. For 
placing, player enters starting coordinate, type of ship (A, B, C, S, or D), and direction (L, R, U, D). If the ship goes 
off the screen, an error message will display. For hitting, player only enters a coordinate.

Symbols Used In Shell:
	Home:						Opponent:
	- empty slot: . (black)				- empty slot: . (black)
	- hit: H (red)					- hit: H (red)
	- miss: * (white)				- miss: * (white)
	- un-hit ship coordinate: first letter of ship name (A, B, C, S, or D) (green)


Technical Design:
We are using networking between two computers. We will use semaphores to control the files, and pipes to share them.

Role Assignment:
	Jackie:
	- display
	Yedoh:
	- receive & store user input
	Winnie:
	- receive & store user input

Data Structures:
- struct ship: the info of each ship
	- char * type, struct * coors
- struct coor: coordinates
	- int col, char row
- char ** board: grids
	- empty slot: .
	- hit: H
	- miss: *
	- un-hit ship coordinate: first letter of ship name (A, B, C, S, or D)
- socket: to transfer information
	- just stores boards

Algorithms:
1. after receiving ship placement: calculate all coordinates and prints error message if off board
				   edits structs and grid based on coordinates
2. while loop for playing input: block when it's the other players turn
				 print clear messages about whose turn it is
	    			 edits stucts and grid based on player moves
				 displays new board for both players
3. ending conditions: when all ships on one board have sunken
		      print win/loss messages for each player
	    
Timeline:
	12.26.17: set up program files (.h, .c, makefile)
	12.27.17: set up data structures
	12.28.17: display and receive user input (on one computer with two processes)
	12.29.17: finish with placing ships for both users
	01.02.18: functioning data storage and display hit/miss
	01.05.18: fully working on one computer
